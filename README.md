# BAD-Conventions
Bayesian Action Decoder (BAD) Hanabi Conventions

* Welcome! The goals of this guide is:
1. To understand and document what conventions the BAD AI's are using to play Hanabi
2. Expand it out to 3p+ modes
3. Build on the BAD Conventions found

Currently, What I'm noticing is that the AI always discards the "freshest" slot, unless told otherwise, which we will call slot 1. 

The AI is giving separate actions/meanings to both Color and Rank Clues

Things you can tell your partner about their freshest card:
1. It is now playable
2. It is trash
3. It is a card that should be saved

Color clues:
Red & Yellow: 
- Slot 1 is immediately playable
Blue & White: 
- Slot 1 is Trash
Green: 
- Slot 1 should be saved
